Xelle Fortune,1,"Spotify is constantly going downhill. The random function queues up the same 100 songs every single time I click it, oh & I have 11700 songs saved, so that's mathematically improbable. Even trying to remove those songs, Spotify will readd them to the queue",2025-09-17 00:45:37,https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.spotify.music

Cracken04,1,"I loved Spotify for the longest time but I‚Äôve noticed over the last year or so that their services have gone downhill slowly so it was almost unnoticeable, the prices are increasing and the overall experience feels less user-friendly. Features that used to make the app stand out, like curated playlists and seamless discovery, don‚Äôt feel as fresh or personalized anymore. On top of that, ads and promotions seem more intrusive, and it feels like the focus has shifted more toward maximizing profit than improving the listener‚Äôs experience.",2025-09-16T10:09:50-07:00,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=324684580&type=Purple%20Software

NotBossyimtheBOSS,4,"I love Spotify. Lately I‚Äôve been contemplating switching to Apple Music full time but cannot part with some of the things that I get with Spotify. I love the music, podcast, and now audiobooks! I wish there was not a time limit on how many hours I get for audiobooks though. I don‚Äôt know if Apple music has audiobooks as a part of their music subscription but it‚Äôs definitely worth having. Quick little note of an issue though, Spotify has been glitchy lately.
