# App Review Scraper 📱

A Python-based tool designed to programmatically collect and analyze user reviews from the **Google Play Store** and **Apple App Store**. This project serves as a foundational step towards building automated data pipelines and insightful dashboards for app performance monitoring and user sentiment analysis.

## 🚀 Features

- **Cross-platform Review Scraping**  
  Collect user reviews efficiently from both major mobile app marketplaces using:  
  - [`google-play-scraper`](https://pypi.org/project/google-play-scraper/) for Google Play Store  
  - [`app-store-scraper`](https://pypi.org/project/app-store-scraper/) for Apple App Store

- **Comprehensive Review Data Extraction**  
  Extract key review elements including:  
  - ⭐ User ratings  
  - 📝 Full review text  
  - 👤 Reviewer identity (where available)  
  - 📅 Review submission date

- **Data Export for Analysis**  
  Save extracted data locally as CSV files, enabling straightforward downstream processing.

- **Project Foundation for Advanced Analytics**  
  Establish groundwork for:  
  - Data cleaning and preprocessing  
  - Sentiment and thematic analysis  
  - Integration with cloud platforms and BI tools such as Azure Synapse and Power BI

## 🎯 Project Motivation

Mobile apps generate vast amounts of user feedback that, when properly harnessed, can drive product improvements and enhance customer satisfaction. However, accessing and structuring this data manually is inefficient and error-prone.

This scraper app addresses these challenges by automating the extraction of review data, empowering data engineers and analysts to:  
- Understand user sentiment trends  
- Identify common pain points and feature requests  
- Build scalable data pipelines for continuous monitoring  
- Create compelling data visualizations to support business decisions

By developing this local scraper app, I aim to gain hands-on experience with real-world data extraction techniques that pave the way for scalable, automated analytics solutions.
